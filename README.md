# XcodeFileTemplates

A set of custom file templates for Xcode


## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Symlink it to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source`: `ln -s <clone path> ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source`. Alternatively you can symlink to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/<your group name>` to put templates in a dedicated group in Xcode's *New File...* dialog (note that the group will always be shown last in the dialog which might be not handy).
